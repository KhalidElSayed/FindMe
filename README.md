A simple example I used to understand how to use Dagger and Otto. The app does something! It gets the user location
and places a marker on the map. The user can put the marker in a different position click the map. If the user clicks
the marker, he can share the position using android sharing. The url for google maps is passed to a "shortener" 
(it doesn't really short that much) before it's passed to the intent.
